Hi{% if salutation %} {{ salutation }}{% endif %}!

Though it has been a long time (over a year) since you worked with me on PathAdvisor,
I want to let you know that I am still working on PathAdvisor with the current Beacon 
Academy students. PathAdvisor has changed a lot since you first helped me out, so I 
hope you can help again.
	
Can you add your {{ tag }} experience to your path? Here is a link you can paste into 
a browser:

{{href}}

Please feel free to add other experiences and goals to your path. I'd love to see 
what you've been up to.

Thanks.
