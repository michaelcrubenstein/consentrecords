Hi{% if salutation %} {{ salutation }}{% endif %}!

It has been over a year since you worked with me on PathAdvisor, the web application
I have been developing to help people keep track of their experiences and share their 
stories with others. 
PathAdvisor has changed a lot since you first helped me out, so I hope you can help again.
	
Can you add your {{ tag }} experience to your path? Here is a link you can paste into 
a browser:

{{href}}

Please feel free to add other experiences and goals to your path. I'd love to see 
what you've been up to.

Thanks.
